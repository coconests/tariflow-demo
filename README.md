**Smarter sourcing decisions, made simple.**

Tariflow is an AI-powered web tool that helps hospitality and food businesses make smarter purchasing decisions by analyzing the tariff exposure of the equipment and materials they buy.

Whether you're sourcing prep tables, packaging, or specialty appliances — Tariflow gives you instant clarity on global sourcing risks, alternative options, and cost-saving opportunities.

## 🚀 What It Does

Tariflow V1 is a lean MVP built to serve businesses like **Anntremet Bakery**, who are actively purchasing kitchen equipment during a time of rising tariffs and global supply shifts.

### Core Features
- ✏️ **Product Analyzer**  
  Enter a product description (e.g. *"stainless steel bakery table from China"*)  
  → Tariflow classifies the item, assesses tariff risk, and suggests sourcing alternatives.

- 🛠️ **Tariff Risk Score**  
  Instantly see whether your item is at *High*, *Medium*, or *Low* tariff exposure.

- 🌍 **Alternative Country Suggestions**  
  Find out whether sourcing from Mexico, Vietnam, or the U.S. might be smarter — and why.

- 📋 **Product History Tracking**  
  View past scanned items, risk levels, and decision history — all tied to your account.

## 🧠 How It Works

Tariflow uses:
- **OpenAI GPT-4-turbo** to analyze natural language product inputs and return strategic insights.
- A lightweight backend (Node.js / Express or Next.js) for processing, history storage, and auth.
- **MongoDB Atlas** (or local memory for MVP) to store scanned items and user data.
- **React + Tailwind CSS** for a clean, responsive frontend experience.
- **Vercel** for hosting and instant deployment.
